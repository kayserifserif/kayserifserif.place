As one of the core members of the Gender and Sexuality Alliance at Chinese International School, I created LGBTABC, a website that presents definitions of gender and sexuality terms in a playful way. This digital terminology board grew out of the physical version, which we placed in a central location at school: it displayed standard definitions of the terms and provided Post-it notes for students to contribute their own understandings or questions about the terms. We learned that the growing array of terms can be empowering to those searching for identity, but is also overwhelming and confusing. After a team discussion about the results of the installation, I designed and developed this website to share with a wider audience and open dialogue about the words we use to even begin discussing the complex web of gender and sexuality.
