I asked my lovely friend Cameron for a poem to make something from, and this was the thing! I really liked this approach to project-making and definitely want to try with more people who I admire :)

Notes on the making:

- Originally focused on "minnows like thoughts" by trying to display real-time tweets of people thinking out loud ("I wonder", no retweets mentions or media), but it ended up being about "stream of consciousness". Changed perspective from observation to expression (?)
- Starting to think of some of my work as like&hellip; website poems. Engaging with an emotional idea with some interactive/real-time component.
- File formats! Encodings! Codecs! A complete mystery and a half; I wish I had the chance to learn more about them in film class. I spent way too long fiddling with this and with browser quirks.
- Accessibility: as always, not 100%. Mobile accessibility would be the most important here; other ideas include speech-to-text, support for accented characters and IME languages, more optimised video.
