## Background

This poster was a collaborative project with a classmate in response to an assignment on Charles Dickens' <i>Great Expectations</i> in English class.

## Poem

Our poem was written using direct quotes from <i>Great Expectations</i>, arranged and linked using our artistic license and interpretation of the character and story. It begins with an introduction of the character, almost carnival-style with the listing of titles, then hints at her background, and finally delves into her cold, bitter mind and ends on a haunting invitation to "come and play". We did not employ a rhyming scheme, because we wanted it to be less smooth and more jagged. One technique we used was enjambment and spacing: when there were specific words or parts of a sentence that we wanted to give more emphasis to, we placed them on new lines or indented the line to create more impact.

## Design

To display our poem, we chose to create two posters. One displayed the text of the first stanza, and the second, the rest of the poem. We took inspiration from two things: firstly, the concept of the Victorian silhouette, and secondly, artist Josh Lafayette’s poster for J. D. Salinger’s short story, <i>A Perfect Day for Bananafish</i>, which wrapped a hand-lettered paragraph from the text around an illustration of a gun.

As a result, we decided to create a Victorian silhouette of Miss Havisham, and wrap the text of our poem around it. The choices we made were related mainly to the factors of colour, size, shape, and arrangement. The posters were entirely in black and white, because we saw colour as something saturated with vitality and life, and we wanted the design to convey a feeling of starvation and lifelessness. For size, we tried to vary the heights and widths of the letters so that notable words stood out, such as the words "withered", "ash", "skeleton", and so on. The letters were all drawn freehand without guides, and we deliberately drew them so that they were distorted and disproportionate, sprawling and shaping themselves into empty spaces. We thought that this looked disorienting and reminiscent of spider thread. We used a variation of uppercase and lowercase letters within the words, which contributed to the disorder and confusion. Finally, in terms of arrangement, we wrote, in general, from top to bottom and left to right, but we played with the format by squeezing words together and shaping them around each other so it was fluid.

## Extension

As an extension to the in-class assignment, I decided to develop the design in my own time. After scanning the original poster, I used Photoshop to clean up the image by flattening blacks and heightening whites, then I spent time in Illustrator creating vector outlines of the lettering and illustration.

During this process, my main goals were to, firstly, make the letters more consistent through smoothing out the curves and matching the thicknesses of down- and up-strokes, and secondly, to improve the layout and lettering by adjusting spacing and thickening the letters.

When I felt satisfied with the look of the outlines, I experimented with different colour palettes. Some combinations are shown below.

The character of Miss Havisham is a pitiful and austere one, and I wanted the colours to reflect the coldness of the life she leads. Additionally, the poem, which quotes the novel, includes a description of an "ash white" veil, which strongly supports the wintry tone of the piece. Though the pastels and warm colours looked nice, especially with the soft curves and silhouetted profile, they didn't give the right feeling. Finally, I settled on a monochromatic ice blue combination.

To fully communicate the intent of the poster, I used a [mockup](https://creativemarket.com/egor_shko/1216725-Poster-Mockup-Set" "Poster Mockup Set") to visualise the poster in a similarly cold and blue realistic environment.
