## Background

This was a branding project for a friend's short-term hackathon project.

## Investigation

### Client brief

DevFlight is a platform on which companies can post small jobs for freelancers. When the client asked me to help design the branding, he briefed me on what he thought the logo might look like.

The brain kind of embodies a 'safety' and 'reliability', which is what we as the middleman want to provide. The wings connect us with the other developers and project owners. At the same time, the 'flight' aspect suggests providing an opportunity for both developers and project owners, in that developers can make money and project owners can get stuff done.

### Brainstorm

After looking for inspiration, I found that I felt particularly drawn to a geometric line design, which echoed the idea of connecting people through a platform.
