Created during an intensely virtual, remote, and global time, this project is a reflection on world interconnectedness and our daily waves and flares of activity and wakedness across the globe. The hope is that you could open the webpage at any time during your day/night and see where in the world people are waking up and going to sleep. Inspired largely by Lin-Manuel Miranda’s series of “gmorning, gnight” tweets and his book with Jonny Sun, [Gmorning, Gnight!: Little Pep Talks for Me & You](https://bookshop.org/books/gmorning-gnight-little-pep-talks-for-me-you/9781984854278) :)
