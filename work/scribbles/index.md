## Background

Scribbles is a creative arts anthology of CIS. Publishing twice a year since 2010, it features original art and creative writing from students and faculty. After contributing prose, poetry, and occasional layouts to the magazine for five years, I applied to and was chosen for the position of Layout Director. I spent a few months before the handover as Deputy Layout Director, shadowing the then&ndash;Layout Director, learning about her approach and working process, and observing how the team of Writing Director, Art Director, Layout Director, and Operations Director all worked together to create each issue.

Over the year and a half that I worked on layout, I collaborated with each other director to create a unique and cohesive vision for each issue, centred around each issue's theme, by arranging the writing and artwork of contributors into a visually and thematically interesting narrative.
