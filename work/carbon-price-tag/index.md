## Inspiration

Every purchase we make has a cost for the environment, whether through the farms and factories that create the product, or the complex supply chains that allow the product to be delivered to your doorstep. We know it's our responsibility to save the environment, but we don't have the knowledge to do so. Our tool allows consumers to become more aware of the environmental consequences of their purchases, and to take informed steps towards reducing their carbon footprint. 

## Concept

Carbon Price Tag is a Chrome extension that displays the carbon cost of items purchased on an online store. When purchasing an item, a "carbon price" will be displayed alongside the monetary price of the item, calculated based on real data on the average number of kilograms of carbon dioxide per kilogram of different types of products. We take into account the CO<sub>2</sub> produced during production and the CO<sub>2</sub> produced through the shipping process, and we convert that to a price based on the amount of gasoline required to produce that same amount of CO<sub>2</sub>. The tool also has a budgeting feature; users can track how many "carbon dollars" they spend, and set a "carbon budget" that they can stay aware of through the visuals of the app.

## Potential improvements

As a proof of concept, our extension only works with food products, and only on Amazon Whole Foods. Moving forward, we would extend its capabilities to account for more types of products on more sites. We would also improve the text parsing feature, potentially using natural language processing (<abbr>NLP</abbr>), to more effectively identify and retrieve data for particular products. Finally, we would conduct more research into the calculations of carbon emissions and the components of supply chains, which would help us create a more accountable algorithm and provide a more accurate and comprehensible breakdown of "carbon costs".
