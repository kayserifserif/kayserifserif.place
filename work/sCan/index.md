## Inspiration

With Hong Kong's available land becoming increasingly scarce and the population climbing steadily, waste management has become a major priority for both the government and the citizens. Before waste reaches landfills or incinerators, an integral part of the process is the public trash can. However, the current weekly trash collection system may at times be wasteful, since some trash cans may not be full. Thus, we decided to create an application that would display the full trash cans and their locations, thus saving valuable time and resources.

## What it does

Public trash can and recycling bins are equipped with sensors that are able to detect when the trash can has been filled, each of which is monitored by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. When a certain number of trash cans in a particular district has been filled, the service will identify both the closest collection point and the best route through, thus streamlining the collection process, drastically reducing time, resources, and environmental impact. Over time, the application accumulates a record of each trash can's usage, ultimately providing a comprehensive picture of human activity and therefore littering. This information would be highly useful to governmental departments, allowing more targeted waste reduction or recycling promotion programs, or more effective resource allocation and city planning.

## Next steps

The context of the application has been initially set as city-wide; however, the app could also be applied to smaller scale scenarios such as trash-cans in a particular building, in order to further reduce resource expenditure in the process of waste collection.
