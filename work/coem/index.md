Coem (a portmanteau of “code” and “poem”) is an multi-coded esoteric programming language (domain-specific language?) that seeks to explore ways that poetry can be made purposeful, and ways that code can be made emotional. Drawing inspiration from codeworks, electronic literature, and critical code studies, it strives to bring together the areas of programming, poetry, linguistics, and typography in ways that are interesting, beautiful, and emotional. In feminist opposition to impersonal tech, it foregrounds ambiguity and connections, emotional and metaphorical significance, textual elements, and personal computing.

The project explores questions such as:

- What are the aesthetics and poetics of code and poetry, and how can they be blended?
- What paradigms of code can be imagined in a different light?
- How do the affordances of language shape our interactions with the machine?
- What would a programming language intended for poetry look like?
- How do the concepts of purpose and effect compare across programming and poetry?

This language lacks mathematical operations, rendering it Turing-incomplete. While a Turing-complete programming language is able to model any algorithm, this ability is not considered important to this language. Rather than writing commands to perform actions, the primary principle of the language is writing statements as an experiment and meditation in truth and expression. In this way, it challenges conceptions of purpose and effect. 

This is a project in progress, as part of my senior thesis.
