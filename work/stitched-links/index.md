This is a proof of concept imagining hyperlinks as woven through the fabric of the page, and indeed through the world wide web. Under each hyperlink, the iconic blue underline is redrawn as part of one continuous curve. The thread is revealed only upon clicking, just as every routine click on a hyperlink reveals a larger picture of the interconnected network of websites.

In future iterations, Iâ€™d love to bring in multiple pages, imagining that iconic blue line threading back and forth through them and loosely binding them together.
