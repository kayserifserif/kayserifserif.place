The original thought was about hyperlinks between pages, as in: that iconic blue line threading back and forth through pages and loosely binding them together. But this is a technically easier version that I wanted to implement while I think about how to do that!

The two buttons at the end were a last-minute addition, thinking about, when I started learning embroidery recently, the way it was surprising that I had made such a mess of crossed lines on the back of the fabric while the front looked perfectly neat.
