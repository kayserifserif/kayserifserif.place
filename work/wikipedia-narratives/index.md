The Web is a sprawling metropolis of seven-lane roads and undergrounds and small dirt lanes, with “List of Big Brother 17 (American season) houseguests” and “University of Mpumalanga” living six or fewer connections away. Based on [Wikiracing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikiracing) and Mad Libs, Wikipedia Narratives is a Wikipedia-based narrative tool to create stories that traverse the information highways.
