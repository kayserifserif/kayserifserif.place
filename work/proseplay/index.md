A poem can live so many lives â€” show us how it once was.' In certain places in the text, words or phrases are contained in boxes, suggesting that there are other possibilities than what is currently being shown."

This tool is an exploration of the idea of explicitly allowing for and encouraging a text to hold multiple truths.

To me, the interactivity of the tool opens up so many possibilities for transforming the text or using the text to transform other objects on the page.

This is also my first intentional foray into open source as a creator and maintainer! The tool is something that I've been wanting to use in my own projects and I hope to make it expansive and compelling for others as well.
