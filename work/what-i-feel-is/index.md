The summer of 2020 has been a demanding one. The emotions have come unpredictably: sometimes it is blinkered life as normal, sometimes it is passionate grief and yearning. This is a e-lit tool for writing emotion poems. It uses only monosyllabic words, which I find to be a useful limitation to curate words as well as to produce a strong evocation, and which originally came out of my thoughts one day of “rage and rage and rage and rage”. It also explores the idea of making the interface poetic too, finding analogies of text editor functions (adding a paragraph break, clearing the page, zooming in) in emotional coping strategies (taking a mental break, clearing your hand, grappling with things up close).

The sidebar has three columns: the first with buttons labelled with various emotions, the second with ‘emotional coping strategy’ buttons labelled with various functions, the third with radio buttons for selecting if emotions are ‘unresolved’ or ‘at capacity’.">
