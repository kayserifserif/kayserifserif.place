Responding to a prompt of "technological intervention", I worked in a small student group to create a data visualization project that collects and counts transactions and relationships between Venmo users in our class and extended community. Venmo is a popular mobile service payment application that has socialized monetary transactions through its unique ‘home feed’ page where users can see the transactions of others that they have added as a friend or the transactions of anyone who has a public account. Using Python, JavaScript, and [D3](https://d3js.org/), we developed an interactive ‘web’ that shows the number and nature of transactions between two selected users. Our aim for this project was to show how easily we could gather the information or data of those in our community and comment on how Venmo transactions have become social in nature.
