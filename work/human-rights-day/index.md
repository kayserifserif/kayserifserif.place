## Background

For International Human Rights Day, the Human Rights Group at Chinese International School ran a week-long activity that encouraged people to interact with rolling bulletin boards around the school.

The first board asked:

> What human rights issue concerns you the most?

    <figcaption>What human rights issue concerns you the most?</figcaption>
</figure>

On this board, Post-it notes were provided for people to stick onto the the board, with each colour corresponding to a different human rights issue.

The second board asked:

> Why should we care about&hellip;? Why do these issues matter? What do they mean to you?

</figure>

On each piece of paper, people wrote down reasons why they cared about or advocated for one issue or another, or what personal significance the issues had to them.

The third board asked:

> What kinds of misconceptions/prejudices do you encounter in your daily life?

</figure>

On this board, people wrote down discriminatory speech, behaviours, and structures that they had experienced in daily life or knew about in the world.

When the week came to an end, we wanted to follow up with the school with results from the activity, and perhaps gain some insight into how students in our school thought about human rights.

## Design

I decided to design three posters that gave a summary of the school's engagement with the boards. After other students tallied up the Post-its on the first board and wrote down the responses on the second and third boards, I used the wealth of information to create three posters: We Care About, We Care Because, and We Care in Spite Of.

## Evaluation

From the data, we saw that the top three issues people cared about were:
1. Racial equality
2. LGBTQ+ rights
3. Women's rights

This supported what we knew about the school before, and as these issues are particularly relevant to our daily lives, and are often at the forefront of the news. What we thought was interesting was that workers' rights and mental health awareness were the bottom two of the list.

Firstly, living in Hong Kong, where the culture of foreign domestic workers is very strongly rooted in our lives, we are intimately connected to the issue of workers' rights. The fact that people were less likely to report being passionate about this issue perhaps suggested that people were uncomfortable with the idea that, for many, living in families that employ domestic workers meant they were perpetrators of the problem, however well-meaning they were.

Secondly, for students in a high-pressure environment, mental health is a crucially important issue to learn about and advocate for. However, our sociocultural context and the local culture of our school wasn't necessarily welcoming to discussion and active change, and deep-seated stigmas and preconceptions existed around the topic.

This activity was both a fun change for the group and the school from our usual less interactive activities, and a fascinating look into how students felt and thought about various human rights issues.
