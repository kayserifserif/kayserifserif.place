title: Tell me how the wheel works
description: On the honest joy of accessibility
---

I get to learn how things work! I get to catch glimpses of the often thankless work being done, the steady chugging energy of researchers and testers and teams pushing web standards safely forward. I get to appreciate the sturdiness of the elements we have in hand—the honesty of a `<button>`, the joy of the invention of `<details>`. I get to walk a well-worn path.

Then there's this poetic quality… The way an object can be read and experienced in so many different ways. A website can be a teleportation device; an image can be an oral story; a sound can be a gesture. The way you can write code (elegant, magical, honest?) that hooks in these multiple experiences into an object, so it takes on that much of a fuller and richer life, and is that much better for every person who happens to come across it. 

And I keep wanting to use the word "honest", and words like "thoughtful" and "creative". Lead me not to the suburbia of infinite and garishly dressed `<div>`s, with their blunt-force JavaScript hacks, but to the mixed-use neighbourhood of `<main>`s and `<aside>`s and `<figure>`s, harbouring their own little histories and colours. Reading a post that asked me to consider, for a custom component, what "the closest metaphor" was, and coming to understand that we design (and write and build) things that are answers to many of the same questions, that are metaphors and abstractions hovering around those elusive experiences we're trying to capture.

Accessibility!! (And our honest attempts!) <3
