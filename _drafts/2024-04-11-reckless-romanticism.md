## A short history

[ode to smallness](https://botsin.space/@smallness) is a generative poetry bot that pairs everyday words with phrase templates to produce a sustained symphony of attention and appreciation.

The bot is built with [Tracery](http://tracery.io/), run by [Cheap Bots, Toot Sweet!](https://cheapbotstootsweet.com/), and hosted on [botsin.space](https://botsin.space/). It made its first post on November 1, 2023.

It is the second iteration of the project. Its predecessor was [Nouns as Art](https://twitter.com/NounsAsArt), which made its first post on May 17, 2021 and its last post on April 6, 2023, when [Cheap Bots, Done Quick!](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) closed down due to the end of Twitter's large-scale API usage.

## How the bot was built

I loved the idea of Nouns as Art, but I think the idea of it got a little tired, two years into that project. Looking at everything in the world as art still felt like a deep well of ideas, but I wanted the bot to be a little more proactive in putting out different variations on the idea.

To start, I figured out some starter phrase templates I wanted to use, and played with them by slotting in a couple different words that I had in mind.

Knowing some pitfalls that I know now, the strategy I took to put together a word list might not have been the best. But it did get me started quickly, without worrying too much about getting it perfect. With a little research, I found a couple different sources on the internet that gave me a starting point to put together a words.txt file and a gerunds.txt file. I wanted to leave room for surprise and serendipity, so I didn't curate the lists too much, early on.

When it started out, the bot was posting a broad range of utterances——some were delightfully in the right direction, but some were grammatically awkward, and some were pretty boring.

With time, I've been editing down the word lists a bit more. This will usually happen when I see a post on my feed that contains a word or utterance that feels boring, or that doesn't fit, or that even feels concerning or alarming. The last point is something that I hadn't expected but has become a growing priority for me.

## Trying not to make this a bad place

It turns out that this word bank had contained words that pertained to violence, including self-harm and harm to others. Those words became increasingly concerning when combined with the phrase templates I had provided. With these phrase templates, my intention has been to draw attention to the little things——a flower, the act of running. The phrases are guiding, wide-eyed, thoughtful. When combined with sensitive words like these, though, an unpleasant juxtaposition occurs.

I don't want my attention to be drawn to acts of violence. At least not in the bot's tone of voice, in what it's trying to do. I really, especially, don't want my bot to inadvertently be a bad place for anyone who might have various trigger words or who is sensitive to particular topics. I don't want to risk anyone who follows or finds the bot happening upon a post that causes a shock or sours their day, just because I let in a floodgate of words.

One phrase template I have is `still, the #noun_or_gerund#`. I had imagined it to be a testament to the endurance of living. A certain type of person may try to settle down but… "still, the running".

I've been paving a footpath lined with flowers, and opening it up to the monster trucks of a freeform word list.
