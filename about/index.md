  <p>Hi, I’m Katherine (she/her)! I make things in the pursuit of poetic tech. I grew up in Hong Kong and was raised in a Shanghainese family. I attended the University of Southern California, where I studied media arts, computer programming, and linguistics. I currently work as a front-end developer and designer at <a href="https://fathom.info">Fathom Information Design</a>, where I help figure out interesting ways to explore ideas and answer questions through data.</p>
  <p>My research interests include critical code studies, internet culture and language, interface aesthetics, electronic literature, accessibility, and poetic tech. My works have included codeworks, handmade websites, electronic literature, and information visualisations.</p>
  <p>In particular, I like to explore ways in and around text and building blocks or raw materials.</p>
  <p>Thanks for visiting — if anything here is interesting to you, I’d love to talk! You can reach me on the socials or by email at whykatherine at gmail dot com. :)</p>
