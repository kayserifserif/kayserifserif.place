Carbon Price Tag is a Chrome extension that displays the carbon cost of items purchased on an online store. When purchasing an item, a “carbon price” will be displayed alongside the monetary price of the item, calculated based on real data on the average number of kilograms of carbon dioxide per kilogram of different types of products. We take into account the CO2 produced during production and the CO2 produced through the shipping process, and we convert that to a price based on the amount of gasoline required to produce that same amount of CO2. The tool also has a budgeting feature; users can track how many “carbon dollars” they spend, and set a “carbon budget” that they can stay aware of through the visuals of the app.
