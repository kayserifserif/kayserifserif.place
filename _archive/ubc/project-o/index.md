	<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>In Year 11, my friends and I had the opportunity to work with a graduate art student, who was hoping for technological assistance with her thesis art project. She aimed to demonstrate the art of Chinese water-sleeve dance, especially in communicating its mesmerising fluidity and grace. To achieve this, she hoped to emulate Chris Milk's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5__9hq-yas">"Treachery of Sanctuary"</a>, which is a triptych installation, enabled by Kinect sensors, that transforms your shadow of a figure into a bird as you stand and move in front of screens.</p>
	<h2>Development</h2>
		<p>In creating this product, we faced two primary challenges. Firstly, we needed to create cloths that moved fluidly and airily while still experiencing gravity. (Our attempts to code this can be found on <a href="https://github.com/oaklen/projecto">GitHub</a>.) Secondly, we needed to bind those two objects to a person's hands, as detected by a Kinect sensor.</p>
	<h2>Evaluation</h2>
		<p>Though the installation was immensely exciting and rewarding, there were definitely areas for improvement. Mainly, our client's goal was to showcase the beauty of the water sleeves and to inform audiences of some of the culture and practice inherent within. For example, there are a number of moves and techniques that can be performed with water sleeves. To address this, we could have taken inspiration from games such as Just Dance that give the audience a model to copy as they interact with the product. As we had relatively little experience with creating interactive technology, Project O was a major challenge for us, and much of our time throughout the process was occupied by technical difficulties and roadblocks that appeared when attempting something completely unfamiliar. However, I was hugely bolstered by this experience, because the integration of technology and art was a unique and invigorating endeavour.</p>
