				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>The goal for this project was to create a logo and visual identity for myself.</p>

				<h2>Investigation</h2>
				<p>In my brainstorm, I came up with some ideas I wanted to associate with myself and my work, such as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Chinese heritage and culture</li>
					<li>Love of typography, lettering, and calligraphy</li>
					<li>Detail-oriented</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Design</h2>
				<p>After scanning the sketch, I used Photoshop to clean up the image, removing all superfluous details and artefacts of the image. I then used the image as a guide in creating vector outlines in Illustrator. As an added challenge, I attempted to use <a href="https://theagsc.com/blog/tutorials/so-whats-the-big-deal-with-horizontal-vertical-bezier-handles-anyway/"" title="So What’s the Big Deal with Horizontal & Vertical Bezier Handles Anyway?">HVBHs</a> (Horizontal &amp; Vertical Bézier Handles) as much as possible, which helped me better identify optimal anchor point placement and maintain consistent angles and curves.</p>

				<p>The final step was to add colour. I wanted the colouring to feel:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>fresh,</li>
					<li>bright,</li>
					<li>clean, and</li>
					<li>down-to-earth.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Below are six variations I particularly liked.</p>

				<p>At this point, I was having trouble deciding on colours to use, so I decided to reach out for some feedback. I posted in a graphic design community, and received a surprising amount of positive and constructive thoughts from other designers, which, as my first contribution to a graphic design community, was extremely gratifying and encouraging.</p>
				<p>In my post, I explained that I wanted the monogram to resemble a fingerprint and/or a Chinese wax seal. Others suggested that it was also reminiscent of a paper clip, which I hadn't thought of before, and that I could play with the possibility of widening the mark to edge it more firmly towards the shape of a fingerprint. In terms of colour, one person suggested that if I wanted to more strongly encourage the Chinese association, I might choose to colour the mark red. One comment that reminded me of the benefit of getting feedback from a range of people with a range of experiences and contexts was that a couple of people pointed out that the blue and yellow palette was very similar to that of <a href="http://ee.co.uk/" title="EE">EE</a>, which was something I would never have encountered outside of the UK. Finally, someone suggested that if I really had trouble deciding, I could print a collection of business cards with the logo as spot varnish or digital embossing on differently-coloured backgrounds. I don't have a strong background in print, so this was an option that was new and fascinating to me.</p>
				<p>Ultimately, I decided to use the monochrome palette with dark grey and white, but I also felt happy to keep the other colour combinations handy, because I thought they looked cohesive enough that I could mix them up and use them together if the occasion ever arose.</p>
