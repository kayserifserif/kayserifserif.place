Fourth Edition: Selectric was first published on January 5, 2023. The site is built with Jekyll and hosted by GitHub Pages. The English text is currently set in [TT2020](https://copypaste.wtf/TT2020/) by Frederick R. Brennan, licensed under the SIL Open Font License, version 1.1. The Chinese text is set in <span lang="zh">Èö∏ËÆäÁπÅÈ´î</span> (Libian TC), where available.

## INTENTIONS

I would like this website to

- feel like me
- feel like paper in your hands
- be accessible
- be a [worry stone](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/)
- change with me
- be [lightweight](https://laurelschwulst.com/e/ultralight-fruitful-school/)
- celebrate things i'm excited about
- hold space for my [friends](/carry)
- feel intimate and lovely
- cherish the form
- hold sacred the text
- abound with poetry

<br>
<br>

P.S. I would like to [write](/posts) because I feel the muscle sore from disuse. I feel it acutely, when I reach for the words and end up grasping in that lacuna. Little me wanted to be a writer. Maybe I can work at it, for her.

## WORKING NOTES
- i'd like to use shanghainese in some way!
- there is slightly too much fiddly html in these pages just for some custom styling... i would like to fall back to more markdown and trust the defaults. see, this page! almost nothing needed at all. what's a couple of <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>s between indie webbers?
- is this font readable in long-form text?
- is this font file too big?
- trying to put up some more writing
- more consideration to the chinese font
- webmentions? [edit 240329: added a link to accept webmentions, but not showing anything yet]
- more writing in chinese?
- [book curses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_curse) - PLAGUE BE UPON YE BOTS WHO WOULD SCRAPE OUR DATA...
- links to headings
- attention to print styles
- are there forms of interaction that i'd like to embed in here?
- accessibility statement
- ~~robots.txt~~ [edit 240329: done? following [Chris Coyier‚Äôs post](https://chriscoyier.net/2024/03/29/11198/)]
- make sure faded colors are still high enough contrast
- ~~set up rss~~ [edit 240326: done!]
- optimize images... use webp?
- microformats?
- add video descriptions and transcripts to videos
- look into prose.io?
- .htaccess https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/blockin-bots/

## CHANGE LOG (WHEN I POST ABOUT IT, AT LEAST)

### Feb 29, 2024

selectric on cyanotype ‚Äî dark mode theme for my website. this felt like it took so long and that was frustrating (feeling like i sometimes only have snatches of time), but i'm really glad i figured out a direction i feel so excited and happy about. i wanted it deep and moody like winter evenings, rich like fabric, glinting like gold leaf. i think i resisted this for so long but i'm really enjoying it and it's something i desperately needed to do for accessibility as well :)

thanks so much to @jamie for the invaluable feedback :')

### Jan 3, 2024

updated the website with a new font (thank you @nonnullish !! :)) and the hopefully lightweight stickies/receipt aside (spent forever figuring out how to import a debounce function). i loved the previous font but am excited about the improved versatility of this one for longer-form writing :)

### Oct 20, 2023

a couple tentative new pages for the website: /carry/ and /index/

kayserifserif.place/carry/: a delightful mishmash, using <iframe>s, of some of my friends' websites, with all the unexpected side effects and errant javascript and console logs <3

kayserifserif.place/index/: an ongoing index of themes in the work. i'm trying to learn more about the craft of indexing, both as traditionally conducted for a Published work like a book, as well as in the fuzzier context of a live, updating work like a website/portfolio. what does that look like? i know the answer is probably something algorithmic, or tools-for-thought-ish, but for now i like the exercise of taking time to reflect on the work and manually tease out relevant and interesting themes.

other notes: i love this light font, but it can be hard on the eyes. i'm trying to improve the contrast, but apologies for it not being quite there yet!

### Feb 6, 2023

i loved the look of these program notes, how the music and the (movement titles?) evoke such a strong sense of a journey

i wanted to take inspiration for something similar on the ‚Äúabout‚Äù section of my website

### Jan 6, 2023

i have a new website and i love it ü•πü•π

this is the first major redesign i've done in maybe 6 years. i'm so happy about it because i know my interests and taste have evolved and become much more specific and clear to me, and this makes me feel like i can finally let other people see it as a rep. of me & my work!!

and more than that, it finally starts to feel like *my* place on the internet ‚Äî somewhere i can come back to and tend regularly and sit in and have fun with. there are more interactive and experimental elements i want to add but this feels like a much better starting point

i also wanted to bring in those elements of metadata and archiving and front/back matter that i like so much! the table of contents is inspired by diana wynne jones, and the metadata for each project is tracked in a spreadsheet that i keep for myself

my goal is to make it feel lightweight but elegant, detailed but relaxed, and clean but *warm*!! the same way this typeface by @mjmcmaster (like Light Italic, and Vulf Mono) is sort of a simple monospace but so lovely and warm and sweet (thank you so much for this!!)

(p.s. there is also a 404 page)
