Hi! I'm Katherine.

I'm a **creative technologist** aspiring to get involved in fields such as **data storytelling/journalism** or **interactive exhibition/experience design**, especially for **social good** or **public humanities**.

Hailing from Hong Kong, with roots in Shanghai, I'm currently a second-year Media Arts + Practice student in the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where we study and make critical new media. At USC, I'm also minoring in computer programming and linguistics, two fields that inspire and inform my creative work. 

I love making imaginative and thoughtful media that engages people, tells stories, and explores ideas in interesting ways. To do this, I've worked as a designer and developer on a wide variety of projects. Creatively, I've had experience in graphic design, information design, print design, film and animation, 3D, branding, and marketing. Technically, I enjoy working as a computational artist in Processing, as a front-end web designer/developer in <abbr>HTML/CSS</abbr> and JavaScript, as a developer in Python, Java, and C++, and as a data scientist and visualiser in R.

Aside from those things, I'm also passionate about accessibility, urbanism, environmentalism, internet culture, and science communication.
