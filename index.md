Hi! I'm Katherine.

I love design and technology, and anything that beautifully combines the two.

This means anything from **data storytelling** to **user interface and experience design**, to **computational arts**, to **human&ndash;computer interaction**.

On the design side, I'm a huge typography nerd, and I've worked on projects involving graphic design, information design, print design, film and animation, branding, and marketing. On the technology side, I'm primarily a front-end web developer using HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and I also have some experience in Python and Java.
