Hi! I'm Katherine.

I love integrating art, design, and technology.

This means anything from **computational art** to **data storytelling**, to **user interface and experience design**, to **human&ndash;computer interaction**.

On the design side, I'm a huge typography nerd, and I've worked on projects involving graphic design, information design, print design, film and animation, branding, and marketing. On the technology side, I enjoy working as a creative coder in Processing (the arts-oriented programming language), as a front-end web designer/developer in HTML/CSS and JavaScript, as a developer in Python, Java, and C++, and as a data scientist in R.

Aside from the technical skills, I'm passionate about accessibility, language, the environment, and science communication.
