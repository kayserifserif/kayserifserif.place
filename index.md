Hi! I'm Katherine. I make things in the pursuit of poetic tech. Born in Hong Kong and raised in a Shanghainese family, I am a recent graduate from the University of Southern California, where I gathered different theories and practices in a hodgepodge of media arts, computer programming, and linguistics. I currently work as a designer and developer at [Fathom Information Design](https://fathom.info/), where I help figure out interesting ways to explore ideas and answer questions through data. My favourite mottos include "move slow and fix things" and "don't tell the poets". (Also, "the machines have learned enough".)

My research interests include critical code studies, internet culture and language, interface aesthetics, electronic literature, and poetic tech. My works have included codeworks, handmade websites, electronic literature, and data visualisations. I am currently in the process of developing [Coem](https://www.coem-lang.org), a poetic programming language.

Take a look at my [résumé](/resume/yang-katherine-resume-202111.pdf) <span class="fileInfo">(pdf, 83 kb)</span> and my portfolio to explore my work so far!
