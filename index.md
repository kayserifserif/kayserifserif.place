Hi! I'm Katherine. I'm a creative technologist creating poetic tools in the pursuit of soft tech. Born in Hong Kong and raised in a Shanghainese family, I am currently a senior at the University of Southern California, where I gather different theories and practices in a hodgepodge of media arts, computer programming, and linguistics. My favourite mottos include "move slow and fix things" and "don't tell the poets".

My research interests include critical code studies, internet culture and language, interface aesthetics, electronic literature, and poetic tech. My works have included codeworks, handmade websites, electronic literature, and data visualisation.

Take a look at my [résumé](/resume/yang-katherine-resume-202111.pdf) <span class="fileInfo">(pdf, 83 kb)</span> and my portfolio to explore my work so far!
