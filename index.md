Hi! I'm Katherine.

I love integrating art, design, and technology.

This means anything from **data storytelling** to **user interface and experience design**, to **computational art**, to **human&ndash;computer interaction**.

On the design side, I'm a huge typography nerd, and I've worked on projects involving graphic design, information design, print design, film and animation, branding, and marketing. On the technology side, I enjoy working as a creative coder in Processing (the arts-oriented programming language), as a front-end web designer/developer in HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and as a developer in Python and Java.

Take a look at my [résumé](/resume/yang-katherine-resume-201903.pdf) to see what I've done!
