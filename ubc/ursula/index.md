	<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Inspired conceptually by the <i>Eloise</i> books and visually by films such as <i>Am√©lie</i> (2001) and <i>Napoleon Dynamite</i> (2004), <i>ursula</i> is a humble short film about a fiercely individualistic girl dealing with overwhelming infatuation and devastating heartbreak.</p>
	<h2>Role</h2>
		<p>As cinematographer for this junior thesis film, I worked with two classmates to craft a light-hearted and offbeat love story. I used lighting and colour grading that emphasised the girlish and playful character and set design, except for particular scenes that show her outside of her comfort zone, which were tinted blue. In the spirit of celebrating youth, I used retro iconography and cinematography to evoke a sense of nostalgia throughout the film. For example, this was achieved through the 4:3 aspect ratio, which was the universal video format of the 20th century, and center framing, which kept the larger-than-life character the focus of the film. In addition to directing photography, I also created chapter cards to mark the three sections of the storybook-like narrative. These cards used blending modes to create an anaglyph-inspired superimposition of handwriting-style text on whimsical animal illustration.</p>
