<div class="greeting">
	<h1>Hi!<br>I'm Katherine.</h1>
</div>

<div class="about-me">
	<!-- <p>I love design and technology, and anything that beautifully combines the two.</p>
	<p>This means anything from <span class="term">data storytelling</span> to <span class="term">user interface and experience design</span>, to <span class="term">computational arts</span>, to <span class="term">human&ndash;computer interaction</span>.</p>
	<p>On the design side, I'm a huge typography nerd, and I've worked on projects involving graphic design, information design, print design, film and animation, branding, and marketing. On the technology side, I'm primarily a front-end web developer using HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and I also have some experience in Python and Java.</p> -->
	<p>My work so far spans the fields of graphic design, editorial design, information design, animation, branding, film, and user interface/experience design. I believe the most distinctive characteristic of my portfolio is the integration of technology and design. On one hand, careful attention to visuals and experience makes technology that much easier and more enjoyable to use. On the other, understanding of software and hardware can greatly broaden the scope of the possibilities in art.</p>
	<p>In my approach to design, I value simplicity and accessibility, which often translates to flat compositions, solid colours, subtle gradients, and geometric shapes. Additionally, as a long-time font enthusiast, I place particular emphasis on typography and typesetting. In terms of the design process and thinking, I believe research and testing are highly useful. For some of my more involved projects, I have conducted interviews with potential users, created wireframes and mockups, and sought feedback through user surveys and quality assurance.</p>
	<p>Artistically, mainly as exemplified in my film work, I’m interested in using styles such as gentle magical realism and whimsical fantasy to explore themes such as childhood, love, and self-discovery.</p>
	<p>More technically, data storytelling is a practice that hugely inspires me. This is a phenomenon that has been seen increasingly in digital editorials: instead of using a wall of text to communicate a nuanced story, data scientists and designers use technology to create an immersive and interactive exhibition of news and data. I have begun to explore this through personal analytics—tracking and analysing my daily habits—as well as infographic design.</p>
	<p>My portfolio demonstrates my interest in human-centred technology and design, and my passion for exploring how we, as makers, can consider the many facets of human nature and society and use technology to make people’s lives better.</p>
