				<h2>Design</h2>

				<h3>Specifications</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>The design will be composed of the basic geometric shapes of circles, triangles, and rectangles.</p>
						<p>My client wants a simple, minimalistic design, which can be achieved by using simple geometric shapes. Additionally, this method will be easier to carry out practically.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The design will use two to five colours.</p>
						<p>The design should have some colour so it looks more visually appealing, but not too many that the design is overwhelming and not cohesive.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The colours used should form a cohesive colour scheme and be pleasing and soothing to look at.</p>
						<p>With colour being used in most of the design, if not all, the colours cannot clash heavily, or it will immediately become unappealing and will not be enjoyed by the user.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The design will fill the entire screen.</p>
						<p>The screensaver should be immersive and make use of the screen real estate&mdash;if not with movement, then at least <li>with colour or other design elements.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The background will be static and the foreground elements will be animated.</p>
						<p>If there is too much animation, the screensaver will feel overwhelming; therefore, it would be much more effective to have the more important elements be more dynamic.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The design will have five or more states of animation that loop infinitely.</p>
						<p>It should be dynamic enough to look interesting and keep the user’s attention. Having the animation loop infinitely allows it to look smooth and aesthetically pleasing, and also serves the function of a screensaver, as it will be left on for an indefinite amount of time.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The animation must not be too complex or advance infinitely.</p>
						<p>My research has shown that if there are too many elements or animations to be performed, the screensaver may not perform as expected or will exert a major strain on the computer’s resources, which will cause a negative user experience.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The animation should not be too fast or too slow.</p>
						<p>If the animation is too fast, the product risks causing strain on the user’s eyes; if it is too slow, it may cause the user to lose interest or find it unappealing. Therefore, the speed of the animation must be of a suitable rate.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Ideas</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>This design features a dark background with light-coloured overlapping circles in the foreground, arranged in a circle. The number of circles and the size of the shape increases to a certain point (specifically, when the shape reaches or surpasses the limits of the frame), then decreases until the original frame is displayed. There are 20 frames in total. This design has a dynamic sense of movement, with animation happening in three different aspects: the number of circles, the spacing of the circles, and the size of the shape. This engages the user through a sense of dimension and movement.</p>
						<img src="/img/screensaver/design-1.gif" alt="Design 1">
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>This design features a light background with darker-coloured circles in the foreground. There are three layers of depth, each surrounding the lower layer. In each layer, the shape is constructed with three circles arranged equidistant around a circle, overlapping to form a rounded triangle in the center, which surrounds the bottom layers. As for the animation, there are 23 frames in total. The top and bottom layer rotate anti-clockwise, the middle layer rotates clockwise, and each lower layer animates faster than the above layer. This design features a greater sense of depth and complexity, while still maintaining minimalism because of the simple geometry of the shapes.</p>
						<img src="/img/screensaver/design-2.gif" alt="Design 2">
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>This design features a light background with a foreground of randomly placed circles of different sizes, not overlapping. Each circle comprises four concentric rings, coloured in different shades of the same hue. For each frame of the animation, the colours of each ring move outwards, so that it looks like the rings are rippling. There are 4 frames in total, one for each change in the rings. This design is more colourful, with 5 colours instead of 2, and more varied, with randomness instead of symmetry and uniformity.</p>
