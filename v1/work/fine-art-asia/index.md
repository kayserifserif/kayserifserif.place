During my internship with the creative branding agency Superunion, I worked in the emerging digital creative team, which gathered creative technologists to reimagine branding experiences and to engage customers more compellingly. Using Processing and OpenGL shaders, I ideated and created two branding activation experiences for clients. Through collaborating with experienced strategy and design colleagues, I created this project as an interactive accompaniment to the client's rebranding, which examined their interest in the interplay between old and new. After completion, the project was shown at the entrance of the 2019 Fine Art Asia exhibition as part of the rebranding's soft launch.
