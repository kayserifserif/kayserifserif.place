	<h2>Background</h2>
		<p><i>To the Moon and Back</i> is a short film about Luna, Harry, and Mia&mdash;three misfits who find trivial misfortune on a night that celebrates family and home.</p>
	<h2>Role</h2>
		<p>For this thesis film, in collaboration with two classmates, I strived to evoke the work of Wes Anderson, whose films feature richly detailed and symmetrical compositions. I was also influenced by <i>La La Land</i> (2016), which uses deliberately fantastical colours. I also drew inspiration from Edgar Wright’s <i>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</i> (2010), whose elaborate graphics imbue it with a sense of playfulness and make the connection between film and audience more tongue-in-cheek, or conspiratorial.</p>
		<p>As cinematographer, I aimed to style visuals that helped craft a light-hearted and idiosyncratic story. Colour was crucial to my artistic vision: I wanted the images to be full of hues that may not occur naturally, but that elevate the film from realistic fiction and transport the viewer into a more fantastical version of life. To that end, I designed deliberately exaggerated lighting and colour grading that washed the settings and characters in a dreamy tone. During pre-production, I helped plan the sets and props in choosing locations with visually interesting backgrounds, and in designing costumes that matched the colour palette of each respective character.</p>
		<p>As editor, I was responsible for cutting together a cohesive and fluid narrative, as well as creating visual graphics that filled in narrative holes and augmented the film’s humour. For example, the story of Harry and Rebecca's breakup is overlaid with a simple graphic of video game hearts, representing Harry's emotions. As he coasts from surprise to disbelief to defensiveness to heartbreak, the hearts decrease and increase accordingly, symbolising his juvenile personality and naïve perception of life as a game. Additionally, at under 7 minutes, the film has precious time to set up premises for each individual story; therefore, the character profiles at the beginning of each story help quickly establish each protagonist's main conflict. In the blunt statement of Mia being &ldquo;bad at art&rdquo; and her sister, Morgan, being &ldquo;good at art&rdquo;, it is easily understood in the ensuing sequence that Morgan is surreptitiously making hasty changes to Mia's art piece.</p>
