what's feeling stressful, wanting to do well or something else?

put that on the map too? maybe imagine where it might be?

the unknown unknowns I think we acknowledge when we locate our "subject position' as we write. like i'm this kind of reader/thinker, talking about this, which is what i know about, and i'm speaking from here, not over there or somewhere else i can't even see, where i'd know different things

Oh soooo relatable

it gets all tangled up and pent up, that's the stewing, thinking process when it feels like it will never make sense!

It's like knitting too, at the beginning it feels like it's never going to be a \*thing\*

‚ù§Ô∏è i'm glad it's helpful!! talking it through really helps!
