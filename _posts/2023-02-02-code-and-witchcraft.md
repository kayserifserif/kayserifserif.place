title: On code and witchcraft
description: 
---

Wondering if someone with expertise in witchcraft/folk religion has done any work on code and witchcraft!

What are the rituals and sacred objects of code?

really interested in the idea of defining, conjuring variables and binding (!) values to names. and things like *invoking* methods?

maybe more broader concepts like randomness/procedural generation + divination?

functions, data types, binary representation + …alchemy?

<blockquote>
Alchemists attempted to purify, mature, and perfect certain materials.[2][4][5][n 1] Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of "base metals" (e.g., lead) into "noble metals" (particularly gold);[2] the creation of an elixir of immortality;[2] and the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease.[6] The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to result from the alchemical magnum opus ("Great Work").[2] The concept of creating the philosophers' stone was variously connected with all of these projects.

memory management + consecration, banishing, exorcism, purification…

<blockquote>
In Christianity, consecration means "setting apart" a person, as well as a building or object, for God. Among some Christian denominations there is a complementary service of "deconsecration", to remove a consecrated place of its sacred character in preparation for either demolition or sale for secular use.

documentation manual as grimoire

<blockquote>
A grimoire (/ɡrɪmˈwɑːr/ grim-WAHR) (also known as a "book of spells" or a "spellbook") is a textbook of magic, typically including instructions on how to create magical objects like talismans and amulets, how to perform magical spells, charms, and divination, and how to summon or invoke supernatural entities such as angels, spirits, deities, and demons.[1] In many cases, the books themselves are believed to be imbued with magical powers, although in many cultures, other sacred texts that are not grimoires (such as the Bible) have been believed to have supernatural properties intrinsically. The only contents found in a grimoire would be information on spells, rituals, the preparation of magical tools, and lists of ingredients and their magical correspondences.[2][unreliable source?] In this manner, while all books on magic could be thought of as grimoires, not all magical books should be thought of as grimoires.[3]

dictionaries -> table of magical correspondences

words have power to make things so.
code has power to make things so.
spells have power to make things so.

when we write code for ourselves and our friends, code that this is written with care, with intention and with intimacy, this literally the stuff of magic

tried to see if there were any esolangs that embody this, and, kind of, but

imagining a language where you have to take great pains and undergo rituals to name and instantiate a variable, as if it's a space or being or object that can't be taken lightly

<blockquote>
The Great Spell. The Great Spell is an esolang in which you must create a powerful magic spell to create the effect you desire. To do this, you can create smaller spells with simpler effects to build up to your Great Spell.
