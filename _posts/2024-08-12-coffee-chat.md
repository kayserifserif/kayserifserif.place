Good thing I have a collection of links that I try to kind of keep for this purpose.

- [digital poetics \| Are.na](https://www.are.na/katherine-yang-lztem2o0ac8/digital-poetics-gyzgdydf84i)
- [html energy](https://html.energy/)

Some music stuff? Kind of trying to find things that you might be interested in.

- [JazzKeys, by Plan8](https://jazzkeys.plan8.co/)
- [SynthTyper - Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/synthtyper/ahmmmjockhcjpepcbiacehhlpbbgofdo?pli=1)

And interesting text stuff:

- [Hanzi Maker](https://futureofmemory.netlify.app/hanzi-maker/)
- [Poetry Experiments](http://www.katygero.com/poetry-experiments/)

And starting to get into websites and blogs — I have some friends online who just have these gorgeous websites or writing sites, and I just think this is the power of being able to code even just a little bit! You can make a space that can feel like your own with not very much at all.

- [Strange.Website](https://strange.website/)
- [Stillness.Digital \| A Place To Rest](https://stillness.digital/)

Oh, back to text — there's some interesting stuff for using code to play with text and write poetry.

- [dhowe/ritajs: RiTa for JavaScript](https://github.com/dhowe/RiTaJS)
- [verses verses](http://poems.verses.xyz/#0)

There's actually a really interesting community around making text stuff with technology; here are a bunch of publications and a really helpful list that my friend Katy had curated.

- [the html review 03](https://thehtml.review/03/)
- [Crawlspace](https://crawlspace.cool/)
- [Taper](https://taper.badquar.to/)
- [places for computational poetry - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B9AWI6OCtClxu1WnuXJgq6at0dvIdJwviksExzw0TDA/edit)

Some really friendly and accessible tools for just getting into creative tech and exploring some of that creative freedom and seeing what's possible without having to do a massive amount of coding.

- [Welcome to Processing! / Processing.org](https://processing.org/)
- [Twine / An open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories](https://twinery.org/)

I haven't really managed to spend a lot of time with Bitsy but shoutout to Dri and their games/stories/zines.

I'm really interested in trying to explore kind of constrained or formal writing through coding.

Oh, I forgot to mention this for sound, but Tiger does these really interesting pieces where he uses sound not really as music but as part of a really atmospheric experience.

Heck yeah. My journey started on Tumblr... just trying to figure out how to make a nice theme for my blog and get nice colours and cool effects when you hover on stuff!

OK but how do I actually make a website and put it up on the internet?
