my heart is a lace doily in the breeze, a maple leaf in the creek, to be snagged on any little thing

today it's the idea of prepositions :')

little articles shimmering like hot air, just barely visible by how they shape and orient the nouns around them

to be mirrors, signposts, sight lines, sidewalks

the little prepositions that could!

to have the suggestion of â€” a shape, an orientation, be so acute as to manifest into a doing !!
